# Day 1

Today I created my project in Godot, setup Godot hackatime, created a level with coins, platforms, moving platforms, killzones, and an end point. I uploaded assets such as sprites, tilesets, sounds, music, and fonts (credits and license in folder). I also added music, sound effects, and animations.

I logged 5h 14m of progress and got the first level and the HUD done
